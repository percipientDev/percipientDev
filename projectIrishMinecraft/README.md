As an avid Minecrafter and learner of Irish, I've decided to undertake the task of analysing the Irish Language version of Minecraft, and suggest alternative translations where suitable. By no means am I perfect; this is a hobby which also doubles as a learning experience for me. I do not intend on this being a formal project, although if future me shares this with other people, I will do my best to accept any pointers, feedback and criticism. I believe that is how this work can truly mature.

As an analysis of language, things may be;

correct, in which case there's no reason to suggest an alternative, except for dialectal variations for knowledge's sake
I'm no aficionado, so expect things to be missing for certain dialects. I'll try to fill them as I become more experienced. What I know will come first.

partially correct, in which case there may only be a minor error but the language is otherwise legible.
As for what constitutes a minor error, I'm not going to say concretely as this is subjective, but things like a missing genitive, incorrect plural etc. One could forgive these errors.

incorrect, which really mandates a solution.
Explanations of grammar and language features will most likely not be provided - I'm not a teacher. However, where I have to challenge the existing translation in the game, I will have to provide reasons as to why the translation is wrong, and why mine is better. Not the best, or the translation, but an improvement on what exists. In the interest of knowledge and trivia, I might mention certain things.

There is of course, an immense lexis to translate, so this will be organised into relevant sections (and maybe sub-sections) for ease of access. Examples are, but not limited to; menu, wooden items, weapons and tools, etc.

I hope that this proves to be a good resource for those who stumble across it, and I humbly thank you all for giving it your time.
