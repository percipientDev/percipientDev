# About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @percipientDev
- 👀 I’m interested in programming! Though to zone in on some things in specific; game development and cybersecurity, at the moment. I keep an open mind so I've no qualms about learning other things. I also hope to cross this with my interest in languages, and other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, really. But my focus is on C, C#, C++ and Javascript in terms of programming languages. I'm also into Irish - Munster at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Maybe in future.
- 📫 How to reach me via email, percipientwayfarer at gmail period com or here.
